# nuRAFT-Messaging
![conan build](https://github.com/ebay/nuraft_mesg/actions/workflows/build_with_conan.yml/badge.svg)

## Brief

A multi-group service layer for [nuraft](https://github.com/eBay/nuraft)

Provides a middleware to nuRaft which manages multple NuRaft servers all multiplex'd through a single server instance
and cache'd client pairs.

## Changes

See the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for release information.

## Usage

The `nuraft::service` provides a means to register callbacks which instantiate `nuraft::state_manager`s. This callback
is used whenever a group is directly created (`service::create_group(...)` ) or when the `grpc::Service` receives a
`RaftMessage` indicating a request to join a group which one does not already belong.

Routing of messages is handled by this library and uses a `global` thread pool for `nuraft::raft_server` bg threads.
Therefore scaling is only bound by available persistence (for logstores and state snapshots), and network resources.

You must still provide the following:

* `nuraft::state_machine`: Provides hooks to implement `commit()`, `snapshot()`, `rollback()` etc.
* `nuraft::log_store`: Logstore (e.g. [Jungle](https://github.com/eBay/Jungle) or [Homestore](https://github.com/ebay/Homestore)).
* `nuraft_mesg::mesg_state_mgr`: RAFT state persistence. Loads/Stores state for the state_machine, snapshots etc.

A simple echo server and client can be found in `test_package/example_{client,server}.cpp`

# Conan builds

## Notes

Currently this project can only be built on Linux using the GCC compiler toolchain. Work is on-going to support other
platforms (e.g. MacOS) using the Clang and VSCode toolchains. Please feel free to contribute changes that support this
endeavour.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the [Symbiosis Library](https://github.com/eBay/sisl) which is currently not available
in conan-center. If using conan-center one must first export this recipe to their local conan cache, example:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/eBay/sisl sisl
$ conan export sisl/ oss/master
```

## Building the Package

This project is typically built from a combination of conan.io and CMake (which must be installed on the host).
```
$ pip install -U conan
$ conan create --build missing . <user>/<channel>
```
